# In Progress   

The following features are currently in progress and will be available for use soon.  
* **Contribution Points**: Giving Employers the ability to turn on ‘points’ for Employees. 1 point is given for each dollar contributed either via Employer or Employee contribution. 
* **Employee Leaderboard**: Giving Employers the ability to turn on a ‘leaderboard’ on the Employee Home Page. This is meant to drive engagement for employees via gamification. 
* **Employee Goals**: Giving Employers the ability to self-organize and create goals that their team work towards. 
* **International Languages**: Right now, the product defaults to English. We’re working on a feature to let any user change their default language. 
* **International Payments**: Right now, the product defaults to USD. We’re working on a feature to let any Employer change their default payment currency.
