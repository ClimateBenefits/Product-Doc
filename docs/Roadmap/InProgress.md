# In Progress   

The following features are currently in progress and will be available for use soon.  
* **Employee Goals**: Giving Employers the ability to self-organize and create goals that their team work towards. 
* **Climate Benefits API**: Giving developers the ability to access our features programmatically. This includes measuring, offsetting, and reporting carbon emissions.
* **Workflow Personalization**: Currently, employees can choose to set their contributions to 'recurring'. This feature would allow employees to customize how they manage their Climate Benefits: over email, in Slack, etc.
* **Emissions Calculator Automation**: Giving Employers the ability to connect to their internal tools to automatically calculate their carbon emissions and keep track of changes over time visually. This would supplement the self-reporting calculator.
