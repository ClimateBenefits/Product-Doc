# Payroll / HR   

We enable Employers to integrate Climate Benefits with their Payroll or HR system. This integration is currently a secure one-way sync to mass import employee data into the Team page. This saves Employers time of uploading Employee data one at a time. 

Currently, we support ADP Workforce Now, Bamboo HR, Gusto, Insperity, Justworks, Namely, Paychex Flex, Paycor, Paylocity, QuickBooks Payroll, Rippling, Run Powered by ADP, Square Payroll, TriNet, and Zenefits. 

We use [Finch](https://tryfinch.com/) to provide this integration.
