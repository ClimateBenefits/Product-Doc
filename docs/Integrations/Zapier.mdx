## Connect Climate Benefits to hundreds of other apps with Zapier 


[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/climate-benefits/integrations) lets you connect Climate Benefits to 2,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.
