# Pricing Plan    

There are two pricing plans available to customers:   
* **Starter**: $5.00 / employee per month, paid monthly. 
* **Enterprise**: $4.50 / employee per month, paid annually. 

Employers are able to start on a Free Trial to start setting up their account: selecting benefits, connecting a payment method, customizing the benefit, etc. When on the Free Trial, Employers are unable to add Team Members until they select a Pricing Plan. 

To select a Pricing Plan:   
1. Go to the [Settings](https://www.app.climatebenefits.com/employer/settings) page. 
2. Click on the Pricing Plan sub-navigation. 
3. Click on the blue “Upgrade” button on either the Starter or Enterprise tier. 
4. On the pop up, enter in the Number of Employee Seats you’d like the purchase. As you change the number, you’ll see the amount your card on file will be charged. 
5. Click on Pay Now. You’ll see a confirmation message with your updated subscription. 
6. Now go to the [Team](https://www.app.climatebenefits.com/employer/teams) page to see the number of seats available to your account. As you add employees, this number will update automatically to give you full visibility.
