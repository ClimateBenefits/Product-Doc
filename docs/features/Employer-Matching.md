# Employer Matching

Employers can activate an **“Employer Matching”** program that matches Employee Contributions up to the amount that is set. The matching program increases the amount of the monthly stipend dynamically. 

For example, if an Employee has a monthly stipend of $10 and an Employer Matching program of $10. If the Employee contributes $15 out of pocket in the first month, they now have $20 available to spend in their monthly stipend. 

To activate a Employer Matching program:    
1. Go to the Settings page. 
2. Click on the Account Information sub-navigation. 
3. On the Employer Matching field, enter the amount desired.
4. Click on the blue ‘Save’ button.
