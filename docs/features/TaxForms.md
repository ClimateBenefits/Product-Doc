Some of the Climate Benefits Providers are 501(c)(3)s. Climate Benefits helps customers claim tax credits based on contributions to these organizations. 

To claim the tax credits:   
1. Go to the [Reports](https://www.app.climatebenefits.com/employer/reports) page. 
2. Click on the Tax Forms sub-navigation. 
3. Select the year that you’d like to export. 
4. Click on the blue ‘Download’ button. 
5. Send this PDF to your CPA or accounting team. Include the PDF attachment in your tax filing. 

According to the tax code, you can claim up to 10% of your company’s income with these types of deductions. We do suggest reviewing the data with your accountant or lawyer before filing for these tax credits.
