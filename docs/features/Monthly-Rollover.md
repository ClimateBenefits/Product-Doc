# Monthly Rollover 

Employers can activate a **“Monthly Rollover”** program that works just like a cellular minutes plan: any funds that aren’t used rollover to the next month. 

To activate a Monthly Rollover program:   
1. Go to the Settings page. 
2. Click on the Account Information sub-navigation. 
3. Click on the toggle next to the Monthly Rollover text. 
4. Click on the blue ‘Save’ button. 

Once activated, the Monthly Rollover activates 30 days after your Climate Benefits program started.
