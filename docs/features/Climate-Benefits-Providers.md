# Climate Benefits Providers 

Climate Benefits Providers are the companies that we work with to combat climate change. Providers are categorized into one of the following:   
* Carbon Removal Projects 
* Advocacy Organizations 
* Volunteering Opportunities 
* Products & Services 

Each Climate Benefits Provider has a quantified amount of carbon dioxide that is reduced. Climate Benefits works with each of these organizations to purchase carbon credits before they appear on the product. 

To customize the Climate Benefits Providers available to your employees: 
1. Go to the Benefits page. 
2. Click on the benefits. 
3. If you want to include a benefit in the program, click on the blue ‘Select’ button. 
4. On the modal that appears, click on ‘Confirm’. 

Employers can also select **“Select All Benefits”** to include all available benefits to the Employees. This is a popular option to give employees full flexibility when choosing where to allocate their stipends.
