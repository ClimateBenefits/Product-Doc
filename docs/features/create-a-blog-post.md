# Switch to Employee View

Admins are able to switch between Employer and Employee views. This allows a user to experience both sides of the software. 

To switch between the views: 
1. Click on your name on the top right corner of the page. 
2. On the dropdown, click on “Switch to Employee” view. If this doesn’t appear for you, contact your team members to make you an admin from the Team page. 
3. Once you’re on the Employee view, click on the link in the dropdown again to return to the Employer view.
