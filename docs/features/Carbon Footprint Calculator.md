# Carbon Footprint Calculator

Employers can estimate their carbon footprint on Climate Benefits. 

To change your default currency: 
1. Go to the Measure page. 
2. Fill out the answers to the 9 questions. 
3. Click on the blue ‘Save’ button.
4. See your estimated carbon footprint. Additionally, this number will now appear on the Home page.

Employers can also purchase a Full Analysis for a one-time fee of $5,000 from the Measure page. Purchasing from the product charges the payment information on file. You can also reach out to your Account Manager for more details.
