# Contributions 

Employees have 2 options for contributions:    
1. **Employer Contributions**: This is paid out of the monthly stipend through the company. 
2. **Employee Contributions**: This is paid out of pocket from the employee. 

When an Employee does a contribution, they also have the option to set it to “Monthly Recurring”. This feature enables them to automatically contribute to the same Climate Benefits Provider on a monthly basis for the same amount.
